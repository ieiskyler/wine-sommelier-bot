# 🤖 Chatbot Project Scaffold

A modular chatbot application scaffold featuring a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. This project is designed for rapid prototyping and easy integration of advanced features such as NLP models, custom recommendation engines, and more.

---

## 🚩 Project Goals

- Provide a clean, extensible starting point for chatbot applications
- Enable easy integration of AI/NLP models and custom logic
- Support modern frontend and backend technologies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone 'https://github.com/ieiskyler/wine-sommelier-bot'
   cd wine-sommelier-bot
   ```
2. **Backend setup**
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Frontend setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app:app --reload 
   ```
2. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## 🧩 Extending the Scaffold

This scaffold is designed for easy integration of new features:

- **NLP Model Integration:**
  - Add your NLP model (e.g., spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers) in the backend.
  - Create new endpoints for intent detection, entity extraction, or custom logic.
- **Custom Recommendation Engines:**
  - Integrate data-driven or ML-based recommendation logic in the backend.
- **Frontend Enhancements:**
  - Add new UI components, chat features, or connect to additional APIs.

---

## 📝 Example: Adding an NLP Model

1. Install your NLP library in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `transformers`, `spacy`).
2. Load and use your model in `backend/app.py`:
   ```python
   # ...existing code...
   import spacy
   nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
   # Use nlp() in your endpoints
   # ...existing code...
   ```
3. Update the `/chat` endpoint to use your model for intent detection or response generation.

---

## 📦 Future Integrations

- Advanced NLP (intent detection, sentiment analysis)
- Database support (user profiles, chat history)
- Authentication & user management
- Third-party API integrations
- Real-time communication (WebSockets)
